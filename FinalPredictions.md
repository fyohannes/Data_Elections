**<font size="3"> Introduction </font>**

Throughout the last couple of months, I have created predicitive models for the 2020 outcome. I have looked at variables including GDP growth, unemployment, poll support, campaign advertisements, federal spending, incumbency, and COVID-19 deaths. In this Final Prediction Blog post, I will be choosing a few variables that I deem to be of the most significance and incorporating them in a model that can hopefully predict the not too far away election.

In my model, I decided to use GDP growth, poll support, and change in federal spending as my predicitve variables, with incumbency as my control. I decided to use these three variables for a multiutde of reasons. First, I , wanted to have a model that primarily focused on fundamentals,such as incumbency and the economy. The economic variable that I used in this model is GDP growth, a variable that has historically has had a strong correlation with presidential outcomes (citation). For example, if GDP increases in the quarter right before the election, voters may reward the incumbent or incumbent party by re-electing them. The opposite effect would expect to happen if GDP declined. Furthermore, I wanted to use poll support, as it seemed to be a good predictor of popular vote shares for my previous models. It is one of the only variables that somewhat measures public opinion, besides presidential approval, and is a good way to gauge people's sentiment on a particular candidate. Besides GDP growth and poll support, I also wanted to look at another economic variable tied to incumbency, federal grants. In previous models, I particulary looked at the effect of change in federal grant spending on presidential outcomes. Similiar to GDP growth, an increase in federal grant spending correlated with higher support for the incumbent candidate/party. 

Overall, I used these three variables in my model to predict the national and state by state outcome for this upcoming presidential election.

As I mentioned in my introudction, I operationalized the variables, GDP growth, change in federal spending, and poll support in my model to predict the presidential election of 2020.

While historically, there has been a strong correlation with 2nd quarter GDP growth and presidnetial outcomes, I actually decided to use 2019 quarter 4 GDP as my variable of choice. The main reason why I decided to do this was because of the effect that COVID has had on the economy, both in the first quarter and in the second quarter of 2020 (mostly in the second quarter). Becuase the economy has declined due to a public health crisis and not a financial crisis, people's perception of the impact of this current recession may be different. Quarter 2 GDP growth has been a good predictor variable historically because it allows for voters to attribute blame and success to the incumbent or incumbent party. However, if voters percieve this economic crisis as an independent and uncontrollable event, it attributing blame and success becomes much more difficult. Thus, some voters may weigh economic conditions from end of 2019 more heavily than that of 2020. It is for this reason, why I decided to use 2019 Q4 data rather than 2020 Q2.

Additionally, I used change in federal spending, as my other economic predictor variable.
