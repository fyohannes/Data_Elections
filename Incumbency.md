**<font size="3"> Presidential Elections and Federal Grants  </font>**

Many people wonder if Incumbent parties and presidents benefit from incumbency? Is there something uniquely distinct about being an incumbent president and running for president? Is it the name recognition? The ability to use presidential powers to sway voters in the upcoming election? While some scholars such as blank argue that incumbency does not matter as much as we think, because of the Time for Change Model (the theory that after multiple years with the same party, voters are inclined to vote for the party not in office). Nevethless, I will explore the history of a possible incumbency advantage and factor any findings in my model for the 2020 Presidential election.

First, the graph above compares the number of popular vote wins from incumbent parties by party. As we can see from the graph above, in 9 out of the 18 elections since 1948, the incumbent party has won the popular vote share. It's important to note the difference between winning the popular vote vs the actual election as there are times where the winner of the popular vote loses the electoral college, and thus the election, as in the case of 2016. However, this graph doesn't show a signifcant advantage to incumbent parties. They seem to win the popular vote at rates similar those candidates from the opposing candidate. If it is not the incumbent party in itself that gives a comparative advantage? Perhaps, there may be other factors that are important to note when thinking about incumbency.

I will noq explore if there is any particular incumbency party advantage, particulary with federal grants. I will look at federal grants as a way to analyze if presidential powers, such as increasing federal grants, has any effect on the outcome of the election. Presidents may use the powers of their office to increase federal spending as a way to incentivize voters to vote for them, thus an example of when incumbency could give some sort of advantage.

In the graph above, I explore different grant amounts for election years vs non election years and swing states vs composed states.
