**<font size="5"> Incumbency: Can being an Incumbent Give You an Advantage? </font>**

**<font size="3"> Presidential Elections and Federal Grants  </font>**

Many people wonder if Incumbent parties and presidents benefit from incumbency? Is there something uniquely distinct about being an incumbent president and running for president? Is it the name recognition? The ability to use presidential powers to sway voters in the upcoming election? While some scholars such as blank argue that incumbency does not matter as much as we think, because of the Time for Change Model (the theory that after multiple years with the same party, voters are inclined to vote for the party not in office). Nevethless, I will explore the history of a possible incumbency advantage and factor any findings in my model for the 2020 Presidential election.

First, the graph above compares the number of popular vote wins from incumbent parties by party. As we can see from the graph above, in 9 out of the 18 elections since 1948, the incumbent party has won the popular vote share. It's important to note the difference between winning the popular vote vs the actual election as there are times where the winner of the popular vote loses the electoral college, and thus the election, as in the case of 2016. However, this graph doesn't show a signifcant advantage to incumbent parties. They seem to win the popular vote at rates similar those candidates from the opposing candidate. If it is not the incumbent party in itself that gives a comparative advantage? Perhaps, there may be other factors that are important to note when thinking about incumbency.

I will now explore if there is any particular incumbency party advantage, particulary with federal grants. I will look at federal grants as a way to analyze if presidential powers, such as increasing federal grants, has any effect on the outcome of the election. Presidents may use the powers of their office to increase federal spending as a way to incentivize voters to vote for them, thus an example of when incumbency could give some sort of advantage.

In the graph above, I explore different grant amounts for election years vs non election years and swing states vs core states.For core statees we see 5.7 billion dollars awarded for election years and 16.23 awarded for non election years. For swing states we see 8.75 awarded during an election year and 24.1 during non election years.  When comparing swing states vs core states, we see that swing states on average recieve more federal funding than core states. Furthermore, there also is a considerable amount of federal grants awarded during election year. During election years, states recieve more federal grants than average. We can find this average by dividing the non election years by 3 and comparing it to the federal grants awarded during election years. For core states, they recieved on average around 4.07 billion, while swing states recieved around 8 billion . As we can see 5.7 billion is much higher than 4.07 billion, likewise with 8.75 billion as well. From this, it seems like there is evidence that the amount federal grants during election years, perhaps suggesting that this is one method in which incumbents/incumbent parties use their power to gain more support from the American peple.

This discussion in regard to federal funding is incredibly fascianting when considering the increased amount of federal spending in 2020 due to the coronavirus. Can federal spending on coronavirus help us predict the outcome of the 2020 election? Is it a reliable predictor variable?



The map above shows us the amount of federal spending on coronavirus throughout the countries. Those with the largest aid awarded to them include California and New York, states that have large populations and have had larger coronarvius outbreaks since the middle of March. However, it is also to note that the next two states with the largest coronavirus grants awarded to them are Texas and Florida, a swing state. Other swing states that have recived a considerable amount of federal aid include Pennsylvania,North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona. This is interesting to note as data from the New York Times shows that the states who have the largest number of cases per capita per week are actually not the ones who are getting the most funding.These states include South Dakota, North Darkota, Wisconsin, and Utah. I will note that there are large population differences between the aforemetnioned states and those states with the largest population, but it still is something interesting to consider? Is it just a coincidence that swing states are getting large amounts of federal aid (beyond the reason of larger populations)?



**<font size="3">  Presidential Model: Predicting Outcome </font>**

In my model, I decided to include federal grants as a predictor variable, alongside poll support averages from my last post []. When conducting my regression, I foung that the coefficent was _  the poll support coefficent was and the federal grant coefficent was . 


#include table

The table above shows that without any poll support and federal aid awarded throughout the coutnry, the incumbent party would expect to recieve. For percentage increase in poll support, the incumbent party would recieve an increase in the popular vote by and for every increase in federal aid dollar the incumbent could expect an increase of ___ in popular votes. 

The model's R squared value, which is 0.88, shows that this is a good fit for the model. I explored if this model was a good fit for the data in other ways, including out of sample testing for the 2004 election and graphing the residuals from the model
