**Welcome Page**

Hello! Welcome to my blog. This blog is part of an ongoing project that I am conducting for Gov 1347, an Election Analytics class taught by Professor Enos at Harvard University. Every Monday, I will update this blog with new data in the hopes of creating a model that will successfully predict the 2020 election.
