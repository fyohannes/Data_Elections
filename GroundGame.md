Deciding where to campaign is key question for many campaign teams. What states should they campaign in? How many offices should they open? The graph below investigates some of the differences in campaign strategy for field offices between Democrats and Republicans.

In the last two elections, Democrats have completely dominated the field office arena. In 2012, Obama had close to 800 field offices and Romney had around 300. In the 2016 election, Clinton had a little over 500 field offices and Trump had less than 200. Part of the decline in overall field offices between 2012 and 2016 could be due to the prominence of social media in campaign strategy and perhaps it's impact on reducing the amount of field offices needed.Neverthless, over the last two elections, Democrats have had much more field offices in comparison to their oponents. But what does this mean in terms of election outcome. Do field offices matter?

Field offices are clearly an intergral part of campaign strategy. Deciding where to place a field office comes with great thought and consideration. Do you place a field office in a safe state such as Massachsuetts or Lousianna, as a way to further induce the wave of blue and red, respectively? Or do you put it in a swing state and concentrate more of your efforts there?

Generally, candidates end up allocating more time and resources into swing states, which also results in increased field offices. The graph above compares field office allocations for Trump and Clinton in eight swing states mentioned in the first blog post. As one would expect, Clinton had more field offices in swing states. The only state that Trump had more field offices in was Arizona. Otherwise, Clinton generally had more field offices. She particularly had increased field offices in Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. However, despite the number of field offices, she lost all four states. Thus, does field office numbers make a difference? Or are there other aspects of the ground game that have a larger imapct?

Throughout the entire 2020 election, Arizona has been deemed a swing state. A historically red state that has not voted for a Democratic candidate in over 24 years is now a purple state [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/opinion/arizona-biden-trump-2020.html]. There are multiple plausible reasons for this, such as Arizona's overwhlming moderate stance on both the right and the left;however, some state that Arizona's shift could be due to demographic shifts.These demographic shifts include increased relocattion to Arizona for employment purposes, as well as the increase in the Hispanic/Latino community.
