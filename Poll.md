**<font size="3"> Presidential Elections Polls Historically </font>**

Every presidential election covers one aspect, in particular, the economy. But what does the economy entail? Is it the stock market? Inflation rates? GDP growth? Many scholars have investigated this topic, specifically exploring the effect that Quarter 2 GDP growth can have on presidential elections. Scholars have generally found that this variable can be a significant predictor variable for the outcome for the election because voters generally give more weight to recent experience (Achen and Bartels). Given that scholars have found a strong correlation between Quarter 2 GDP growth and election outcome, it would be interesting to compare the difference in effect that this has on the incumbent party versus a non-incumbent party.
