**<font size="3"> Campaign Advertisments Over Time  </font>**

During election seasons, many of us are probably constantly surrounded by campiagn advertisements. From billboards to t.v commercials and social media, campaign advertisements have been a pillar of presidential elections. But what influence do they have? What purpose do they serve?

The graphs above show the top 5 most popular issue areas for campaign advertisements (Years 2000 and 2004) and the the top 3 most popular issue areas for campaign advertisements by party (Years 2008 and 2012). In years 2000 and 2004 one can see that the most popular issue areas actually weren't policy related topics. Of the policy related topics, the most popular issue areas in 2000 included education, taxes, and health care. In 2004, the most popular 
policy related issues included employment and health care. In 2004, there are also ads that speak on terrorism, which shows a a shift in the politicial landscape after 9/11. Something notable about the 2008 election, is the frequency in which economic policy was discussed, most likely due to the serverity of the recession that was simultaneoulsy occurring. In 2012, issues related to the economy still remain at the forefront of advertisements, including debt/deficit, taxes, and employment.



**<font size="3"> Social Media in the 2020 Election  </font>**

As we've seen in the graphs, advertisments play a versatile role and can have cover a broad range of topic. What about the use of social media for advertising? Recent elections have seen an increase use of social media for campaign related advertisements. Surprisingly, social media has been a popular media to address political issues and elections in generally. Especially, now that Trump has somewhat normalized the use of social media in politics. Thus, it would be interesting to consider what groups are using social media the most for the upcoming election.

The graph above uses data from https://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/releases-100120/#data and shows the leading advertisements teams in the number of ads. There are a mix of third party establishments, supporters of a particular candidate, and even a running candidate leading the way in advertisements. The top team teams include the Public Opinion Group and Keep Trump in Office Party. Something to note in this graphic is the "Vote by Mail 2020" page team. This definietley highlights some of the complexitiites that COVID-19 had introduced into this upcoming election. There is a large push to vote by mail this year; however, this issue has been very polticized, thus I wonder if the "Vote by Mail 2020" page team is endorsing/ supporting Biden,a proponent of voting by mail.

Another interesting thing to consider is the effect of advertisements and voter turnout in Swing States. What is the effect of advertisements in swing states? How can voter turnout play a role in that?

The graphs above show win margins for Biden and Trump for the 8 important swing states that I indentified in my blog post. They depict regression models that predict Biden/Trump win margins given voter turnout for both Republicans and Democrats within the state (from 2016). In order to create these regression models, I looked at voter turnout by party from 2016 and current poll support averages in these states from 270 to win https://www.270towin.com/2020-polls-biden-trump/.

In these graphs, almost all the swing states showed a Biden win, with the exception of Georgia. I'm hesitant to say that these are accurate predictions, especially for North Carolina, where a 20 percent win margin for Biden seems very unreasonably. Furthermore, I think the election race in Arizona will be a lot closer than what the model predicts now. Arizona was once known as a red state, however, in this upcoming election, it seems like Arizona will be a lot closer. Additionally, from these graphs we can see many swing states with smaller win margins for Biden, including Florida with around 3 percent and ___ with around 6 percent.

Now that we've investigated the effects of poll support and voter turnout on win margins for swing states, we can use that data to include the effect of campaign advertisements. Gerber et al and Huber et al investigate this through the impact of GRPs on win margins. GRPs are gross point ratings and are calcualted by multiplying the reachable audience with the number of airings of advertisements. The two models differ slightly in their formulation. In Gerber's model an increase in 1,000 GRPs leads to an increase of the vote share of around 5 percent, while Huber estimates the increase in the vote share is around 7.5 percent.

Let's applying these models to Florida, a swing state that has a relatively small win margin for Biden,accoording to our previous graphs. Using the Gerber, we see that an increase in 1000 GRPsn in the last week of the election, which is around 0.4-0.6 million dollars of advertisement, leads to a win margin for Trump around 6.22462 percent. For the Huber model, an increase in 1000 GRPs in the last week of the elction gives Trump a win margin of 6.229824. As we can see, both of these models predit similiar outcomes in terms of the inpact of increaed GRPs in the last week of the election.


**<font size="3"> Conclusion </font>**

Advertisements play an intersting role in elections. They're meant to persuade and incentvied voters to vote for a specific candidate. They have a variety of different purposes, from economic policy to making candidate appeals, and they cover a vast variety of different mediums, from T.V to social media.
